This project aims to provide a package to typeset a ball program for a Scottish
Country Dance club, including a list of dances with the source, length, and
tempo of each as well as the (conventionally somewhat abbreviated) directions
for each dance.

The package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1.3c or
later; the LICENSE file contains a copy of that license.

This project is not affiliated with [the Royal Scottish Country Dance
Society](https://www.rscds.org).
